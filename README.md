Code for Jetbrains Academy's Python Course (run via Hyperskill)

## Hyperskill Introduction
In the Python Developer track, you will get acquainted with the basic syntax of Python. You will work with different types of data, use standard and third-party libraries, and learn to handle most common errors in your code.

By the end of this track, you will easily write programs to automate everyday tasks, get and process data from different sources (files, databases, web-pages), or develop a console app. Starting from simple projects like programming the Hangman game, you will move on to more challenging ones and will be able to implement your own browser, hack passwords, or create a website!
